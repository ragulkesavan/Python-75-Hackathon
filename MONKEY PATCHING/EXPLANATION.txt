MONKEY PATCHING :

->Monkey Patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module.

->Here i go with proof.
->mod module py file.
->new.py file and its output.
->mod file contains a function func().
->First let us print the address pointed by mod.func().
->Which is done by id(func).
->In new.py mod.func is made dynamically point newfunc().
->This is made by the command mod.func()=newfunc().
->After patching now let us try to print the address of func()  function.
->Trying id(func) prints a new address since we changed it by dynamic patching.
->We can see here in output of two address after executing new.py.
